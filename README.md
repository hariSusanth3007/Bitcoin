Cryptocurrency tracker


			This website is used to track the real time changes in the value of cryptocurrency. I have built a real-time bitcoin ticker dashboard which displays the change in its value. There are 3 KPIs on top of dashboard which showcase real-time values of top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. The line-chart below the KPIs demonstrate a Bitcoin Ticker where the variation in bitcoin prices are captured. This website is created using Cryptonator API data source https://api.cryptonator.com/api/ticker/btc-usd this will fetch the realâ€“time data for the Bitcoin Ticker.
